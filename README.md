**Overview**

I created this project just for fun. It simulates card counting
strategies in Black Jack games.

**Why a Black Jack Simulator?**

I lived in Reno, Nevada as a child, and spent much time in casinos
tagging along with my Father while he worked selling chemical supplies
to casinos. I was fascinated by the math built into casino games. I have
read a stories of famous gamblers. When reading those stories, I usually
find myself thinking how fun it would be to try and do the same thing. I
figured a computer simulation might be a good place to try out my
gambling-chops, while keeping my hard earned money in my pocket.
